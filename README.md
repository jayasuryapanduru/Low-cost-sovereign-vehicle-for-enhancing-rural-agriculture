 ## Abstract 
Project aims to create an agricultural robot that will help with necessary farming activities like sowing seeds, spraying pesticides, cutting grass, and ploughing. 
In contrast to previous projects that were complicated and expensive, this AGRIBOT utilizes energy from the sun using a solar panel-fed battery. 
It has a Bluetooth module, making it easy to control using a Bluetooth terminal application. 
This configuration makes it possible for users to effectively command the AGRIBOT to carry out different agricultural activities.
