# Low-cost-sovereign-vehicle-for-enhancing-rural-agriculture
 ## Abstract 
Project aims to create an agricultural robot that will help with necessary farming activities like sowing seeds, spraying pesticides, cutting grass, and ploughing. 
In contrast to previous projects that were complicated and expensive, this AGRIBOT utilizes energy from the sun using a solar panel-fed battery. 
It has a Bluetooth module, making it easy to control using a Bluetooth terminal application. 
This configuration makes it possible for users to effectively command the AGRIBOT to carry out different agricultural activities.

## Objectives
   1. Efficiency - Increase agricultural efficiency and reduce labor costs.
   2. Cost-Effective - System should be affordable and less complex compared to previous methods.
   3. Precision - Improve precision in farming tasks for optimal yield.
   4. Sustainable Energy - Utilize renewable solar energy to power the robot
## Proposed Work
   The proposed Agri Bot is designed to revolutionize agricultural practices by automating key tasks with renewable energy. 
   The system is driven by an Arduino Uno R3 controller, which orchestrates various functions including seed sowing, watering, ploughing, and grass cutting. 
   Powered by an 12V solar panel that charges a 12V battery, the Agri Bot operates sustainably and efficiently. 
   It utilizes DC motors for seed sowing and grass cutting, with a motor driver managing directional movement.
